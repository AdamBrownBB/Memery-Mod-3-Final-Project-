# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/memery/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/memery/log/*
/memery/tmp/*
!/memery/log/.keep
!/memery/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/memery/storage/*
!/memery/storage/.keep

/memery/.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/memery/config/master.key
