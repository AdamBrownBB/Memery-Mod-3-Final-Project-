# Memery-Mod-3-Final-Project

Welcome to Memery, a meme- and gif-matching memory game.

There are four levels available which get progressively more challenging as you go through them. For example, level one employs a 3x3 grid of cards, which includes 4 pairs of memes/gifs to match and 1 'bomb' - click on it by accident and you lose the game. 

In level two, the grid becomes 4x4 with 7 pairs of memes/gifs to match and 2 bombs. Level three has a 5x5 grid with 3 bombs and level four has a 6x6 grid with 4 bombs - very challenging indeed so tread lightly.

Scoring is calculated based on the number of steps it takes you to match all available memes and gifs. The more steps it takes you, the lower your score will be. Winning a game level will automatically advance you to the next level.
