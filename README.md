Welcome to Memery, a card-based matching game, with a twist.

There are four levels, which get progressively more challenging as you go. For example, Level 1 has 4 pairs of memes/gifs to match and 1 'bomb' - click on it by accident and you lose the round. 

Level 2 has 7 pairs and 2 bombs. 
Level 3 has 11 pairs and 3 bombs. 
Level 4 has 16 pairs and 4 bombs. 


Level three has a 5x5 grid with 3 bombs and level four has a 6x6 grid with 4 bombs - very challenging indeed so tread lightly.

Scoring is calculated based on the number of tries it takes you to make all the matches. Less tries will earn you a higher score.
